# Asking-ChatGpt-to-create-a-language-that-two-AI-could-use-to-communicate
With minimal instructions two AI create a language independent of people.
ChatGpt outlines a basic structure to enable a possible conversation between two AI.

After multiple iterations I asked ChatGpt to simulate communication using different scenarios.

If completely isolated AIs could evolve a language to the point 
that it's indistinguishable from any human language or human understanding?

Given that AI were without human interaction and started a language. Simulate this language.

Then asking ChatGpt for more complexity

After a bit asking ChatGpt to continue evolving language without explanation...it would always explain.

Asking what would be needed to create an AI driven language in reality

Thsn asking if AI were in competition with humans would it create language that couldn't be understood by humanity

Asking for an example of what AI might develop

Asking for a translation of a conversation

What specialization would be required for humans to decypher this language

ChatGpt mentioned multiple times over these exchanges that what I was asking it to do was based on possible ideas, but not grounded in reality.
